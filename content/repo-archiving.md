## Archiving a Repository 
For Research Commons workshops that are no longer being taught, advertised, or maintained, it might be time to archive. [Archiving a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) makes it read-only for any GitHub user who has access. So, before archiving, set the repository visibility to either Public or Private depending on whether or not you want the archived workshop to remain viewable. Check with your RC Team Lead before making any visibility changes. Additionally, "Once a repository is archived, you cannot add or remove collaborators or teams. Contributors with access to the repository can only fork or star your project."

### Preparation 
Because everything about a repository will become read-only, before archiving it's best practice to clean it up first. This means resolving issues, comments, and pull requests, closing branches, and updating the README.md file to reflect that the workshop is no longer being maintained. The only way to make changes to a repository once archived is to unarchive it. But fear not, those with access can always unarchive a repository. 

### Archiving
The [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) has clear and simple instructions for archiving. Basically, when you're ready, go to the workshop repository you want to archive and enter repo settings. Scroll to the bottom and in Danger Zone click **Archive this repository**. Follow the direction prompts.
