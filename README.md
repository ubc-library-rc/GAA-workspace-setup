# GAA Workspace Setup
### UBC Library Research Commons

This is a simple workflow designed to help new GAAs set up a developer environment on their personal computer. If your role requires you to build or edit workshops using git and GitHub, this guide may help you.     
_Note: as of now, the guide is for mac users, though in time it may be adjusted for windows operating systems as well._
